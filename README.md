## Programming language 

A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs. Most programming 
languages are text-based formal languages, but they may be also be graphical. They are a kind 
of computer language.

The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) 
and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined 
by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) 
while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. 
Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the 
dominant implementation being common.

Programming language theory is a subfield of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, 
analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.

## Python (programming language)

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code 
readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented 
and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive 
standard library.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and 
first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as 
list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, 
released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. 
Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

**Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages**
